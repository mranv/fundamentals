## 1. Introduction

The Cloud Platform Fundamentals documentation provides a comprehensive overview of fundamental concepts related to cloud computing platforms. This documentation aims to equip beginners with a solid understanding of cloud computing concepts, architecture, core services, as well as management and governance principles.

## 2. Cloud Computing Concepts

In this section, we delve into the fundamental concepts of cloud computing, including service models and deployment models. Topics covered include:

### What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is a model for delivering on-demand computing resources over the internet. It provides users with access to a pool of computing resources that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort.

### Cloud Service Models

There are three main cloud service models:

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Provides virtualized computing resources, such as virtual machines and storage, over the internet.
- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Offers a platform for developing, testing, and deploying applications without the need to manage underlying infrastructure.
- Software as a Service (SaaS): Delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis, eliminating the need for local installation and maintenance.

### Cloud Deployment Models

Cloud deployment models determine how and where cloud services are implemented. The common deployment models are:

- Public Cloud: Services are offered over the public internet and are available to anyone who wants to use them.
- Private Cloud: Services are dedicated to a single organization and may be located on-premises or hosted by a third-party provider.
- Hybrid Cloud: Combines public and private cloud resources to leverage the benefits of both.
- Multi-cloud: Involves using services from multiple cloud providers to meet specific business requirements.
